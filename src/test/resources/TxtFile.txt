If your custom TestEngine needs to be configured, consider allowing users to supply configuration via configuration parameters. Please note, however, that you are strongly encouraged to use a unique prefix for all configuration parameters supported by your test engine. Doing so will ensure that there are no conflicts between the names of your configuration parameters and those from other test engines. In addition, since configuration parameters may be supplied as JVM system properties, it is wise to avoid conflicts with the names of other system properties. For example, JUnit Jupiter uses junit.jupiter. as a prefix of all of its supported configuration parameters. Furthermore, as with the warning above regarding the junit- prefix for TestEngine IDs, you should not use junit. as a prefix for the names of your own configuration parameters.
